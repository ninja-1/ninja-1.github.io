My name is Dalton Miller and I'm a coder with a focus on DevOps and automation. I've been coding since around 2012 and a DevOps Engineer since 2015.

My goal in life is to automate away everything I don't like doing so I can spend more time on the things I enjoy. So far that has applied well to the DevOps role and I expect to continue down that path for the foreseeable future.

My hobbies include working on cars and motorcycles, coding side-projects, and enjoying the outdoors.

Contact for project availability or just to chat. I enjoy meeting new people: [dalton@daltonmiller.me](mailto:dalton@daltonmiller.me)
